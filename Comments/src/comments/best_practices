1. Comments are not subtitles. Comments are supposed to support the code
   so that when you or anybody comes back to it, they can make sense of it.
   Do not explain every detail.
  
2. Do not just repeat what your code is able to clearly explain.

3. Smelly comments need to be avoided at all cost. When you try to explain
   code in detail to make sure the reader is not confused. it's a signal
   that something is wrong with your code. No comment can fix that.
   
4. Write comments as you go and do not make a habit of going back and
   commenting after code completion.

5. Keep the comments short and precise.

6. When you place comments inline, make sure they are separated from the
   main code with at least two spaces.
