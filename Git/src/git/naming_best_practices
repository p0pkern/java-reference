1. Use group words in the branch name
   - This reveals the branches purpose
   - wip -> Work in progress
   - exp -> Experimental branch for dev purposes
   - feature -> adding a new feature
   - bug -> Issue/bug with code that branch is supposed to fix

2. Use separators
   - Depends on needs of the team
   - bug_login_page_redirect
   - feature-sso-implemented

3. Don't use only numbers

4. Avoid long names

5. Avoid all naming conventions at once
   - Decide on the best practices of the team and apply those.
