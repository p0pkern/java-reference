1. Use pull requests

2. One pull request for one concern
   - There can be several commits, but they should be for one feature.
   
3. Do not ignore pull requests for long.

4. Complete your work before a pull request.

5. Use useful comments with a pull request.

6. Do not mix refactoring with a new feature.
